# Tic Tac Toe Project

This is Web Development Immersive student project built using HTML, CSS \
JavaScript and jQuery. The goal was to build a web application from scratch. I \
started by drawing three wireframes and writing user stories to outline to \
provide a scope for the final project.

The game is currently a single player applicatoin that allows a user to play \
against themself. Known issues that need to be addressed are: \
\
* Authentication (ability to sign up, sign in, change password and sign out)
* Game API (ability reate game, update game and get games)
* UI for game score and counter \\

In addition to addressing the listed issues, I plan to improve the UI with \
modals for form fields and enhanced, cleaner style. \
